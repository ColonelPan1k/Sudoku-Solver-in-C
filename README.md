# Sudoku-Solver-in-C

This is just a simple sudoku solver in C.  It uses recursive backtracking and is based off of a project from 
my summer course at Harvard.  I'll put out a build with the first working version, but for now this is a work-in-progress

# How to use
1. Make a .txt file with the initial puzzle, adding spaces between each number and using 0 for blank spaces.  A few example 
   puzzles have been provided in the "Test puzzles" folder.
2. Use the CLI command "Sudoku [filename.txt]"
3. Enjoy your solved puzzle
