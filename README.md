# Sudoku-Solver-in-C

This is just a simple sudoku solver in C.  It's a rewrite/port of the same project I did over the summer in my Harvard CS class.  There's nothing really fancy going
on under the hood apart from typical C stuff. 

If you'd like to read about how I wrote this and how it works, check out my blog post [here](https://zhaba.dev/2021/01/04/Programming-a-Sudoku-Solver-in-C.html)

# How to use

1. Make a .txt file with the initial puzzle, adding spaces between each number and using 0 for blank spaces.  A few example 
   puzzles have been provided in the "Test puzzles" folder.
   
2. Use the CLI command "Sudoku [filename.txt]"

3. Enjoy your solved puzzle
